Cherry Tomato
-------------

This is a basic [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) app that we use in our
[Meteor workshop](http://www.okgrow.com/meteor/learn/).

It's a teaching version of Tomato, a team-oriented
[Pomorodo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app built  with
Meteor.

It will have more public commits as the workshop progresses.

Warning: we revise the history regularly so if `git pull` tells you that it's
not a fast-forward you might need to reset to the current version like  this:

```
git fetch origin master
git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD
git clean -df
```
